# Top 10 List of Week 01

1. [Freeware vs Free software vs Open source software](https://dzone.com/articles/free-software-vs-open-source-vs-freeware-whats-the)<br>
In the calss we were asked the difference between free software and open source. Freeware is a software that we can use without paying. Free software is software that we can share, study, or modify. The 'free' in free software means freedom on doing anything with the software, not the price. There are four pillars of freedom for free software:
* The freedom to deploy the software for any use case without restriction.
* The freedom to study how the software works and modify it according to your needs and preferences.
* The freedom to freely re-distribute the software to assist someone in need. The redistribution can be done at a cost or at no cost.
* The freedom to enhance the performance of the software and release your enhancements for the community to benefit both programmers and non-programmers. You can do this at a cost or at no cost.
Open source software is a software that we can access and modify the source code.

2. [Hypervisor](https://www.vmware.com/topics/glossary/content/hypervisor)<br>
Hypervisor is a software that creates and runs virtual machine. Hypervisor is also known as Virtual Machine Monitor or VMM. Hypervisor offer a lot of mobility because we can move around the guest VM regardless of the host hardware. There are two types of hypervisor, type 1 (or bare metal) and type 2 (or hosted). Type 1 hypervisor acts as lightweight operating system and runs directly on the host's hardware. Type 2 hypervisor runs on a software layer, like other user program.

3. [Virtual memory](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/virtual-memory-in-operating-system/)<br>
Virtual memory is a storage allocation scheme that allows secondary memory to be addressed as part of main memory. Virtual memory is implemented by both the hardware and software. It maps memory address used by a program (virtual address) into physical address in computer memory. There are two characteristics in virtual memory. The first one is the memory address is translated into physical address dynamically at runtime. The second characteristic is the process can be broken down into multiple parts and doesn't need to be located in the main memory continuously.

4. [Virtualization and Emulation difference](https://www.hitechnectar.com/blogs/virtualization-emulation/)<br>
Virtualization splits a single physical system into a multiple virtual machine. The virtual machine use the dedicated resources from the host hardware. Emulation imitates the processor from one device to another. In virtualization, the virtual machine can access the hardware resources. Whereas in emulation, it needs a software bridge to interpret the emulator code to be readable by the host.

5. [Virtualization cost](https://www.techadvisory.org/2019/07/advantages-and-costs-of-virtualization/)<br>
By using virtualization, it removes the need to to buy more hardware to create a machine. Virtualization coordinates with the hardware so it removes the need to update the hardware. By using virtual machine, we can take a snapshot of our machine regularly so backing up the data is less demanding. If the machine broke down, we can also easily restore it by using the backup image or migrating it to another hardware.

6. [Cloud services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing#Service_models)<br>
Cloud services is a service that is delivered online. There are different types of cloud services. The first one is Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). IaaS provides infrastructures such as virtual machines, servers, network, storage, load balancer, etc. The second on is Platform as a Service (PaaS). PaaS provides developer environment such as execution runtime, database, web server, etc. The third one is Software as a Service. In SaaS, the user gain access to application software, such as CRM, virtual desktop, games, etc. All this services is available through the internet.

7. [Virtual file system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_file_system)<br>
Virtual File System (VFS) is an abstract layer on top of a physical file system. It's purpose is to allow a uniform way on accesssing the file system from different system. By using VFS, it can bridge the difference from Windows and Linux file system. VFS Specify an interface in the kernel. That makes it easy to add new file system support to the kernel by specifying the interface.

8. [Copyleft software](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/copyleft.en.html)<br>
Copyleft software is a general method on making a program and or extended the modified version of it to be free. Copyleft software makes people able to share their programs and their improvements. The 'left' in copyleft software doesn't mean to leave, but as the opposite word of right. This means that copyleft software is the opposite of copyrighted software.

9. [Software licenses](https://www.synopsys.com/blogs/software-security/5-types-of-software-licenses-you-need-to-understand/)<br>
There are five different types of software license. The first one is public domain. Software in this category meant that it can be used or modified without restriction. The second one is permisive or BSD. This software contains minimum requirements on how the software can be used or modified. The third one is LGPL or Lesser General Public License. This allows the developer to link open source library in the software. The fourth one is copyleft. Copyleft allows the software to be used or modified, but the modified version must use the same software license, which is copyleft. The last one is proprietary. This one means that it's all rights reserved, which means the software may not be modified or redistributed.

10. [Real-time computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing)<br>
Real-Time Computing or RTC is the term for hardware and software that's subject to real-time constraint. An example of that is event to system response. RTC Is classified based on the consequences of missing a deadline. Hard RTC means that missing a deadline means a total system failure. Firm RTC means that infrequent deadline miss are tolerable, but it may degrade the system service. Soft RTC is the usefulness of a result degrades after its deadline.
