# Top 10 List of Week 02

1. [GnuPG](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GnuPG)<br>
GunPG or GPG is a command line tool with features for easy integration with other application. GPG is used to encrypt and sign data and communication. Using GPG, each user distributes the public key of their keyring, which can be used by others to encrypt messages to the user. The private key must always be kept private, otherwise confidentiality is broken.

2. [SHA256SUM](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToSHA256SUM)<br>
SHA256SUM is used to verify data integrity using the SHA-256. SHA-256 hashes used properly can confirm both file integrity and authenticity. Comparing hashes makes it possible to detect changes in files that would cause errors. The possibility of errors increase as the file becomes larger.

3. [Public Key](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/how-does-public-key-encryption-work/)<br>
Public key encryption, or public key cryptography, is a method of encrypting data with two different keys and making one of the keys, the public key, available for anyone to use. The other key is known as the private key. Data encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted with the private key, and data encrypted with the private key can only be decrypted with the public key.

4. [Breach of confidentiality](https://www.markeluk.com/articles/what-is-a-breach-of-confidentiality)<br>
This type of violation involves unauthorized reading of data (or theft of information). Typically, a breach of confidentiality is the goal of an intruder. Capturing secret data from a system or a data stream, such as credit-card information or identity information for identity theft, or unreleased movies or scripts, can result directly in money for the intruder and embarrassment for the hacked institution.

5. [Breach of integrity](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/OperatingSystems/15_Security.html)<br>
This violation involves unauthorized modification of data. Such attacks can, for example, result in passing of liability to an innocent party or modification of the source code of an important commercial or open-source application.

6. [Breach of availability](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/OperatingSystems/15_Security.html)<br>
This violation involves unauthorized destruction of data. Some attackers would rather wreak havoc and get status or bragging rights than gain financially. Website defacement is a common example of this type of security breach.

7. [Theft of service](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/system-security/)<br>
This violation involves unauthorized use of resources. For example, an intruder (or intrusion program) may install a daemon on a system that acts as a file server.

8. [Denial of service](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/system-security/)<br>
This violation involves preventing legitimate use of the system. Denial-of-service (DOS) attacks are sometimes accidental. The original Internet worm turned into a DOS attack when a bug failed to delay its rapid spread.

9. [Masquarading](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/4020/masquerade-attack)<br>
A masquerade attack is an attack that uses a fake identity, such as a network identity, to gain unauthorized access to personal computer information through legitimate access identification. If an authorization process is not fully protected, it can become extremely vulnerable to a masquerade attack.

10. [Malware](https://www.forcepoint.com/cyber-edu/malware)<br>
Malware is the collective name for a number of malicious software variants, including viruses, ransomware and spyware. Shorthand for malicious software, malware typically consists of code developed by cyberattackers, designed to cause extensive damage to data and systems or to gain unauthorized access to a network. Malware is typically delivered in the form of a link or file over email and requires the user to click on the link or open the file to execute the malware.
