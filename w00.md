# Top 10 List of Week 00

1. [Github page](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/)<br>
I learned how to make a github page. All I need to do is press the repository settings, and then choose a theme. Github will create the page for me.

2. [Operating system functions](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/functions-of-operating-system/)<br>
There are lots of important function in opearating system. Such as system security, controlling system performance, hardware management, etc.

3. [Device driver](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/device-driver-and-its-purpose/)<br>
In the class, we discussed a bit about driver. Basically driver (device driver) is a software that used to communicate between hardware and operating system. There are two types of device driver: kernel-mode device driver, user-mode device driver.

4. [Kernel](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/kernel-in-operating-system/)<br>
I've heard the term 'kernel' thrown around quite often. Kernel itself is the central of any operating system, which manages operations of the computer. There are five different types of kernel: monolithic kernel, micro kernel, hybrid kernel, exo kernel, nano kernel.

5. [Kernel-mode and User-mode](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1311402/what-is-the-difference-between-user-and-kernel-modes-in-operating-systems)<br>
In kernel-mode, a software can access the hardware. This software can execute directly on the CPU and reference memory address. Kernel-mode is usually used by low level function. User-mode is the opposite of kernel-mode. The software cannot directly access the hardware. If it wanted to, then it needs to go through the system API.

6. [Why we need kernel-mode and user-mode](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/User-Mode-vs-Kernel-Mode)<br>
There are several resaons why need both user-mode and kernel-mode. The first one is that a crash in a program in kernel-mode can be fatal, whereas in user-mode it isn't as disastrous. The second reason is a user program can accidentally overwrite the operating system.

7. [API](https://techterms.com/definition/api)<br>
API Stands for Application Programming Interface. An API itself is a command that programmers can use to interract with an external system. In this case, it's used to interract with the operating system.

8. [Structuring methods](https://www.cs.csustan.edu/~john/Classes/CS3750/Notes/Chap02/02_OpSysStructures.html)<br>
There are five different structuring methods: monolothic, layered, microkernel, modular, hybrid. 
* Monolithic structured is that an operating system function run as a single file in a single address. 
* In layered approach, each layer is an object with specific method. A function can call function from another layer. The innermost layer is the hardware and the outermost layer is the user interface.
* Microkernel replaced the monolithic kernel with only the important services. The rest, such as file system and device driver, are turned into user-level program.
* Modular is an operating system design that has similarities with other models. For example, it's similar with the microkernel except that it use dynamically Loadable Kernel Modules (LKM) that are not constrained with other modules. The LKM may be loaded at boot time, but it can also be deleted from memory when no longer needed. An example for this is a device driver module will be loaded when a device is plugged in, and will be deleted when the device is unplugged.
* Hybrid system is combination of all the above. Popular operating system such as ios or Android are made with this system. 

9. [Process management](https://computer.howstuffworks.com/operating-system5.htm)<br>
There are two important factors in managing process. The first one is ensuring each process and application receives enough processor's time to function properly. The second one is using as many processor cycle as possible to do works.

10. [Memory management](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_memory_management.htm)<br>
Memory management is the ability of the operating system to manage the primary memory and switch back and forth between main memory and storage between execution. Memory management keeps track on the memory address and check how much memory does a program consume. It also check whether a memory is free or not.
