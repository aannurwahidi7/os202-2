# Top 10 List of Week 00

1. [One](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/)<br>
I learned how to make a github page. All I need to do is press the repository settings, and then choose a theme. Github will create the page for me.

2. [Two](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/functions-of-operating-system/)<br>
There are lots of important function in opearating system. Such as system security, controlling system performance, hardware management, etc.

3. [Three](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/device-driver-and-its-purpose/)<br>
In the class, we discussed a bit about driver. Basically driver (device driver) is a software that used to communicate between hardware and operating system. There are two types of device driver: kernel-mode device driver, user-mode device driver.

4. [Four](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/kernel-in-operating-system/)<br>
I've heard the term 'kernel' thrown around quite often. Kernel itself is the central of any operating system, which manages operations of the computer. There are five different types of kernel: monolithic kernel, micro kernel, hybrid kernel, exo kernel, nano kernel.

5. [Five](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1311402/what-is-the-difference-between-user-and-kernel-modes-in-operating-systems)<br>
In kernel-mode, a software can access the hardware. This software can execute directly on the CPU and reference memory address. Kernel-mode is usually used by low level function. User-mode is the opposite of kernel-mode. The software cannot directly access the hardware. If it wanted to, then it needs to go through the system API.

6. [Six](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/User-Mode-vs-Kernel-Mode)<br>
There are several resaons why need both user-mode and kernel-mode. The first one is that a crash in a program in kernel-mode can be fatal, whereas in user-mode it isn't as disastrous. The second reason is a user program can accidentally overwrite the operating system.

7. [Seven](https://techterms.com/definition/api)<br>
API Stands for Application Programming Interface. An API itself is a command that programmers can use to interract with an external system. In this case, it's used to interract with the operating system.
