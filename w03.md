# Top 10 List of Week 03

1. [File system](https://searchstorage.techtarget.com/definition/file-system)<br>
File system is the most visible aspect of a general-purpose operating system. It provides the mechanism for on-line storage of and access to both data and programs of the operating system and all the users of the computer system. There are two parts of file system, the collection of files and the directory structure. A file system stores and organizes data and can be thought of as a type of index for all the data contained in a storage device. These devices can include hard drives, optical drives and flash drives.

2. [Virtual file system](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/vfs.html)<br>
The Virtual File System (VFS) is the software layer in the kernel that provides the file system interface to userspace programs. It also provides an abstraction within the kernel which allows different file system implementations to coexist. VFS system calls open, stat, read, write, chmod and so on are called from a process context.

3. [Directory Structure](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/structures-of-directory-in-operating-system/)<br>
A directory is a container that is used to contain folders and file. It organizes files and folders into a hierarchical manner. There are different types of directory structure:
* Single-Level Directory. The simplest directory structure is the single-level directory. All files are con- tained in the same directory.
* Two-Level Directory. A single-level directory often leads to confusion of file names among different users. The standard solution is to create a separate directory for each user. In the two-level directory structure, each user has his own user files directory (UFD). The UFDs have similar structures, but each lists only the files of a single user. When a user job starts or a user logs in, the system's master fil directory (MFD) is searched. The MFD is indexed by user name or account number, and each entry points to the UFD for that user.
* Tree-Structured Directory. Once we have seen how to view a two-level directory as a two-level tree, the natural generalization is to extend the directory structure to a tree of arbitrary height. This generalization allows users to create their own subdirectories and to organize their files accordingly. A tree is the most common directory structure. The tree has a root directory, and every file in the system has a unique path name.
* Acylic-Graph Directory. An acyclic graph is a graph with no cycle and allows to share subdirectories and files. The same file or subdirectories may be in two different directories. It is a natural generalization of the tree-structured directory.
* General Graph Directory. A serious problem with using an acyclic-graph structure is ensuring that there are no cycles. If we start with a two-level directory and allow users to create subdirectories, a tree-structured directory results. It should be fairly easy to see that simply adding new files and subdirectories to an existing tree-structured directory preserves the tree-structured nature. However, when we add links, the tree structure is destroyed, resulting in a simple graph structure.

4. [GNU Compiler Collection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Compiler_Collection)<br>
 GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) is a compiler system produced by the GNU Project supporting various programming languages. GCC is a key component of the GNU toolchain and the standard compiler for most projects related to GNU and Linux, including the Linux kernel. The Free Software Foundation distributes GCC under the GNU General Public License. GCC has played an important role in the growth of free software, as both a tool and an example.

5. [Mounting file system](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19455-01/805-7228/6j6q7ueup/index.html)<br>
To access the files on a file system, we need to mount the file system. Mounting a file system attaches that file system to a directory (mount point) and makes it available to the system. The root file system is always mounted. Any other file system can be connected or disconnected from the root file system. When we mount a file system, any files or directories in the underlying mount point directory are unavailable as long as the file system is mounted. These files are not permanently affected by the mounting process, and they become available again when the file system is unmounted. Mount directories are usually empty, because we do not want to obscure existing files.

6. [Linear list vs Hash table in Directory implementation](https://www.javatpoint.com/os-directory-implementation)<br>
The simplest method of implementing a directory is to use a linear list of file names with pointers to the data blocks. This method is simple to program but time-consuming to execute. The real disadvantage of a linear list of directory entries is that finding a file requires a linear search. Directory information is used frequently, and users will notice if access to it is slow. Another data structure used for a file directory is a hash table. Here, a linear list stores the directory entries, but a hash data structure is also used. The hash table takes a value computed from the file name and returns a pointer to the file name in the linear list. Therefore, it can greatly decrease the directory search time.

7. [Allocation methods](https://www.javatpoint.com/os-allocation-methods)<br>
There are various methods which can be used to allocate disk space to the files. Selection of an appropriate allocation method will significantly affect the performance and efficiency of the system. Allocation method provides a way in which the disk will be utilized and the files will be accessed. There are different methods on allocating disk space:
* Contiguous allocation
* Linked allocation
* Indexed allocation
* Linked indexed allocation
* Multilevel indexed allocation

8. [Disk Partitioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_partitioning)<br>
Disk partitioning or disk slicing is the creation of one or more regions on secondary storage, so that each region can be managed separately. These regions are called partitions. It is typically the first step of preparing a newly installed disk, before any file system is created. The disk stores the information about the partitions' locations and sizes in an area known as the partition table that the operating system reads before any other part of the disk. Each partition then appears to the operating system as a distinct disk that uses part of the actual disk.

9. [Tar](https://www.lifewire.com/tar-file-2622386)<br>
Tar, or short of Tape Archiver, is a file that has the TAR file extension is a file in the Consolidated Unix Archive format. A program or command that can open archives is needed to open a TAR file. Because the TAR file format is used to store multiple files in one single file, it's a popular method for both archiving purposes and for sending multiple files over the internet, like for software downloads. 

10. [Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE)](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/fuse.html)<br>
Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE) is a userspace filesystem framework. It consists of a kernel module, a userspace library, and a mount utility. One of the most important features of FUSE is allowing secure, non-privileged mounts. This opens up new possibilities for the use of filesystems. A good example of FUSE is sshfs, which is a secure network filesystem using the sftp protocol.
